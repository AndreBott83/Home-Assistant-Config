1) Flasch using TasmotaConvert with Raspi
2) Connect to Tasmota and upgrade firmware
3) Set the Module Type Configuration → Configure Module, Select TuyaMCU (54), Click Apply. Wait for Reboot.
3) physically restart device!
4) start configurations over console:
Display the Current Temperature Main Menu → Console, Enter TuyaMCU 71,104 and press enter.
Display the Set Temperature Enter TuyaMCU 72,106 in the console and press enter.
Remove the toggle button in the Web UI Enter TuyaMcu 99,1 in the console and press enter.

Set to Celsius. This can be configured on the device with:
  TuyaSend1 101,0
  
Set Temperature Set point to 4°C
  TuyaSend2 106,40


Cooling Because of the internal scaling by a factor of 10, this results in:
  TuyaSend2 118,20
Heating Because of the internal scaling by a factor of 10, this results in:
  TuyaSend2 117,20
